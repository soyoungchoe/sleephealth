# Sleep Health
This is a competition by DataCamp. I followed a well-developed and organized [analysis](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/6ddb832c-7395-414a-ad70-49bc475926cc) by someone whose account is not public 

## Background
The app called SleepScope by SleepInc monitors sleep patterns and collects user's self-reported data on lifestyle habits. Using the data collected from this app, I need to find out the correlation of lifestyle and sleep quality. I was asked to produce visualizations and a summary of findings for the non-technical audience. 

## Summary
- Focus: heart beat, categories of blood pressure, and pulse pressure.
- Analysis of the interdependencies between 
    1. heart beat, stress, sleeping quality and duration
    2. blood pressure, BMI and the frequency of sleeping disorders. 
- Result: Sleeping quality is degraded by fast heart beat, high pressure, overweight, and stress.
